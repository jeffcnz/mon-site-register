## A Web Based Monitoring Site Register For New Zealand.
The project aims to implement a web based national monitoring site register for New Zealand, allowing the documentation and discovery of monitoring sites.  Sites will be able to be added by registered monitoring agencies, with an overall administration and governance function applying over all agencies.  The site will not provide measurement data, but will be able to provide links to the data.


## Motivation
The need for this kind of application has been identified as part of an environmental data infrastructure (ref).  An Envirolink report in 2017 proposed an identification system and describes the components of a register.  In order for the system to operate and be sustainable there need to be persistent url's for the sites, and a governance structure in place to administer the system.  This has resulted in a chicken and egg cycle where a register isn't created because there isn't a governance structure and a governance structure isn't created because there isn't anything to govern.  By demonstrating a web based site register it is hoped that this cycle of inactivity can be broken.
